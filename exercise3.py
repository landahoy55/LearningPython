# Write a function called count_word_match which accepts three agruments:

# a string which contains multiple words separated by spaces,
# a string which gives the word that you want to count the occurrences of and
# a boolean (True or False) which specifies whether the match should be case-sensitive.

# def count_word_match(words, match, case_sensitive):

#     print(case_sensitive)

#     if not case_sensitive:
#         words = words.casefold()
#         match = match.casefold()

#     wordList = words.split()
   

#     count = 0
#     for word in wordList:
       
#         if word == match:
#             count +=  1
        
#     return count


# count1 = count_word_match("We are going on a cold cold holiday", "Cold", False)
# print(count1)
